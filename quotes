"Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing."
"The most important words a man can say are, "I will do better."
"To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one."
"Accept the pain, but don't accept that you deserved it."
"I will take responsibility for what I have done.If I must fall, I will rise each time a better man."
"Yes, I began my journey alone, and I ended it alone. But that does not mean that I walked alone."
"A journey will have pain and failure. It is not only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The knowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us. But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one."
"But merely being tradition does not make something worthy. We can't just assume that because something is old it is right."

"Plan every battle as if you will inevitably retreat, but fight every battle like there is no backing down."
"In all the history of mankind, has any conqueror decided they had enough? Has any man just said, ‘This is good. This is what I wanted,’ and gone home?"
"I doubt any dragon ever had it so good anyway."
"I could not become a dragon. I am an utter and complete failure."
"You should try to understand what they want out of life, and respect that, rather than projecting onto them what you think they should want out of life."
"If the journey itself is indeed the most important piece, rather than the destination itself, then I traveled not to avoid duty—but to seek it."
"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."
"I will protect those I hate. Even...even if the one I hate most is... myself."
"Failure is the mark of a life well lived. In turn, the only way to live without failure is to be of no use to anyone."
"But maybe you shouldn’t be looking for life to be easier because you choose to do something that is right!"
"We lift the bridge together.And we carry it"
"The first step to being in control was to see yourself as capable of being in control."
"It is not perfection we seek, for perfection is impossible. It is instead consistency."
"If nobody asked questions, then we would never learn anything."
"Pride doesn't win battles."
"No one ever accomplished anything by being content with who they were.We accomplish great things by reaching toward who we could become. As long as it’s what you want to become. Not what someone else thinks you should become."
